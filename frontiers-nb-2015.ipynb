      "# Introduction\n",
      "The largest challenge facing the usage of metagenomic approaches in microbiology is the need to extend traditional microbiology training to include metagenomic or sequencing data analysis. Sean Eddy (a compuational biologist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute) nicely describes the impacts of high throughput sequencing on biology and its training in his keynote address (http://cryptogenomicon.org/2014/11/01/high-throughput-sequencing-for-neuroscience/#more-858).\n",
      "\n",
      "To facilitate the barriers to microbiologists for metagenomic assembly, we have complemented this review with a tutorial of how to estimate the abundance of reference sequences (e.g., genes, contigs, etc.) in a metagenome.  We include approaches that include using references that are both (i) available genome references or (ii) assembled from the metagenome. In general, to complete this tutorial and most metagenomic assembly, one would need:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Access to a server.  Most metagenomic assembly will require more memory than most researchers will have on their personal computers.  In this tutorial, we will provide training on the publicly accessible Amazon EC2 instances which can be rented by anyone with a registered account.\n",
      "* Access to a metagenomic dataset.  We have selected the usage of the HMP Mock Community WGS dataset (http://www.hmpdacc.org/HMMC/) for this tutorial given its availability, practical size, and availability of reference genomes.  This dataset represents a mock metagenome of 22 known organisms for which DNA was extracted from cultured isolates, combined, and sequenced.\n",

      "\n",
      "An advantage of metagenomic sequencing is the ability to quantify microbial diversity in an environment without the need to first cultivate cells.  Typically, most studies access taxonomic diversity (especially with the usage of targeted sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene*).  Diversity can also be measured in the representation of specific sequence patterns in a metagenome.  For example, one can quantify the abundance of unique nucleotide \"words\" of length K, or k-mers, in a metagenome.  These k-mers can also be used in the assembly of metagenomes where overlapping k-mers are indicative of reads that should be connected together.  The diversity of these k-mers can give you insight into the the diversity of your sample.  Further, since assembly compares each k-mer against all k-mers, larger numbers of k-mers present will require more computational memory. A nice review on k-mers and assembly is Miller et al.\n",

A great review on metagenome analysis is Sharpton et al.)\n",

It is advantageous in that it provides longer lengths for sequences that can later be used as references (that may be previously unknown), reduces the dataset size for analysis, and provides references that are not dependent on previous knowledge.  \n",

For most assemblers, the inputs are sequencing reads and paramters for the assembly software.
